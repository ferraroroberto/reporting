-- =====================================================
-- SIMPLE NOTION RELATIONS SETUP - FINAL VERSION
-- =====================================================
-- One-command setup for the entire simplified system
-- Zero configuration required!

-- =====================================================
-- QUICK SETUP (Run this single command)
-- =====================================================

SELECT setup_notion_relations_system();

-- =====================================================
-- VERIFY SETUP
-- =====================================================

-- Check what relations were automatically detected
SELECT * FROM auto_detect_all_notion_relations();

-- See summary of all detected relationships
SELECT * FROM notion_all_relations_summary;

-- =====================================================
-- WORKING EXAMPLES - TESTED AND VERIFIED
-- =====================================================

-- Example 1: View all articles with their expanded relations
-- The system automatically creates views with _universal_relations suffix
SELECT 
    notion_id,
    name as article_name,
    date,
    -- These columns are automatically created from your JSONB data
    rel_author_or_source,  -- Array of author IDs
    rel_comments,          -- Array of comment IDs
    rel_illustration       -- Array of illustration IDs
FROM notion_articles_universal_relations 
WHERE date IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Example 2: Find articles with multiple authors
SELECT 
    name as article_name,
    date,
    array_length(rel_author_or_source, 1) as author_count,
    rel_author_or_source as author_ids
FROM notion_articles
WHERE array_length(rel_author_or_source, 1) > 1
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Example 3: Smart relation resolution with auto-detection
-- The system automatically determines which table the relations point to
SELECT * FROM smart_resolve_relations('notion_articles', 'author or source')
LIMIT 10;

-- Example 4: Join articles with their authors (using computed columns)
SELECT 
    a.name as article_name,
    a.date,
    c.name as author_name
FROM notion_articles a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(a.rel_author_or_source) AS author_id
LEFT JOIN notion_connections c ON c.notion_id = author_id
WHERE a.date > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY a.date DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Example 5: Find all books with their illustrations
SELECT 
    b.name as book_name,
    b.notion_id,
    array_length(b.rel_illustrations, 1) as illustration_count,
    i.name as illustration_name
FROM notion_books b
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(COALESCE(b.rel_illustrations, ARRAY[]::text[])) AS illust_id
LEFT JOIN notion_illustrations i ON i.notion_id = illust_id
WHERE b.rel_illustrations IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY b.name
LIMIT 20;

-- Example 6: Analyze relationship patterns across all tables
SELECT 
    source_table,
    relation_field,
    target_table,
    relation_count,
    unique_targets,
    round(avg_relations_per_source, 2) as avg_per_source
FROM analyze_relationship_patterns()
WHERE relation_count > 0
ORDER BY relation_count DESC;

-- Example 7: Find articles by a specific author using the name
WITH author_lookup AS (
    SELECT notion_id, name 
    FROM notion_connections 
    WHERE name ILIKE '%specific_author_name%'
)
SELECT 
    a.name as article_name,
    a.date,
    al.name as author_name
FROM notion_articles a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(a.rel_author_or_source) AS author_id
INNER JOIN author_lookup al ON al.notion_id = author_id
ORDER BY a.date DESC;

-- Example 8: Cross-table analysis - Articles and their comments
SELECT 
    a.name as article_name,
    array_length(a.rel_comments, 1) as comment_count,
    a.date as article_date
FROM notion_articles a
WHERE a.rel_comments IS NOT NULL 
  AND array_length(a.rel_comments, 1) > 0
ORDER BY comment_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- =====================================================
-- MIGRATION HELPERS - Transition from Old System
-- =====================================================

-- Compare old junction table approach vs new computed columns
-- OLD WAY (junction tables):
/*
SELECT a.name, c.name as author_name
FROM notion_articles a
JOIN notion_articles_to_connections j ON a.notion_id = j.articles_notion_id
JOIN notion_connections c ON c.notion_id = j.connections_notion_id
WHERE j.relation_field_name = 'author or source';
*/

-- NEW WAY (computed columns):
SELECT 
    a.name,
    c.name as author_name
FROM notion_articles a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(a.rel_author_or_source) AS author_id
LEFT JOIN notion_connections c ON c.notion_id = author_id
WHERE a.name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;

-- =====================================================
-- PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

-- Check that indexes were created
SELECT 
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename LIKE 'notion_%'
  AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Verify computed columns exist
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_generated
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name LIKE 'notion_%'
  AND column_name LIKE 'rel_%'
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;

-- Check universal views were created
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_type
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name LIKE '%_universal_relations'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- =====================================================
-- TROUBLESHOOTING QUERIES
-- =====================================================

-- If computed columns aren't working, check PostgreSQL version
SELECT version();  -- Need PostgreSQL 12+ for GENERATED columns

-- Check JSONB structure of your data
SELECT 
    notion_id,
    jsonb_pretty(notion_data_jsonb) as formatted_data
FROM notion_articles
LIMIT 1;

-- See what array fields exist in a table
SELECT DISTINCT 
    key,
    jsonb_typeof(notion_data_jsonb->key) as type
FROM notion_articles,
     LATERAL jsonb_object_keys(notion_data_jsonb) AS key
WHERE jsonb_typeof(notion_data_jsonb->key) = 'array'
ORDER BY key;

-- =====================================================
-- USEFUL AGGREGATIONS WITH THE NEW SYSTEM
-- =====================================================

-- Count total relationships by type
SELECT 
    'Articles -> Authors' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_relations,
    COUNT(DISTINCT notion_id) as source_items,
    COUNT(DISTINCT author_id) as target_items
FROM notion_articles
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(COALESCE(rel_author_or_source, ARRAY[]::text[])) AS author_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Articles -> Comments' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_relations,
    COUNT(DISTINCT notion_id) as source_items,
    COUNT(DISTINCT comment_id) as target_items
FROM notion_articles
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(COALESCE(rel_comments, ARRAY[]::text[])) AS comment_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Books -> Illustrations' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_relations,
    COUNT(DISTINCT notion_id) as source_items,
    COUNT(DISTINCT illust_id) as target_items
FROM notion_books
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(COALESCE(rel_illustrations, ARRAY[]::text[])) AS illust_id;

2. **AUTOMATIC DETECTION**
   ✅ Finds all array fields in JSONB
   ✅ Creates computed columns for each relation
   ✅ Creates views with expanded relations
   ✅ Creates indexes for performance

3. **SIMPLE QUERIES**
   ✅ Use computed columns like rel_author_or_source
   ✅ Use universal views like notion_articles_universal_relations
   ✅ Use unnest() for joins instead of complex junction tables

4. **ALWAYS UP-TO-DATE**
   ✅ Computed columns update automatically
   ✅ No sync processes needed
   ✅ No maintenance required

5. **BETTER PERFORMANCE**
   ✅ GIN indexes on JSONB arrays
   ✅ Stored computed columns
   ✅ Native PostgreSQL operations
