-- SIMPLE NOTION RELATIONS SETUP
-- =====================================================
-- This script sets up the entire simplified system in one go
-- No complex configuration needed!

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: SETUP (Run this once)
-- =====================================================

-- This will automatically set up everything you need
DO $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'ðŸš€ Setting up simplified Notion relations system...';
    
    -- Create the main functions
    RAISE NOTICE 'ðŸ“¦ Creating core functions...';
    
    -- Create dynamic relation columns
    PERFORM create_dynamic_relation_columns();
    RAISE NOTICE 'âœ… Dynamic relation columns created';
    
    -- Create universal relation views
    PERFORM create_universal_relation_views();
    RAISE NOTICE 'âœ… Universal relation views created';
    
    -- Create automatic indexes
    PERFORM create_automatic_relation_indexes();
    RAISE NOTICE 'âœ… Automatic indexes created';
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'ðŸŽ‰ Setup complete! Your system is ready to use.';
END $$;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: USAGE EXAMPLES
-- =====================================================

-- Example 1: Get all relations for any article
-- This automatically detects all relation fields!
SELECT 
    notion_id,
    name as article_name,
    date,
    -- These are automatically created computed columns
    rel_author_or_source as author_ids,
    rel_comments as comment_ids,
    rel_illustration as illustration_ids
FROM notion_articles_universal_relations 
WHERE date > '2024-01-01'
LIMIT 5;

-- Example 2: Get all relations for any book
SELECT 
    notion_id,
    name as book_name,
    -- Automatically expanded relations
    rel_thread_li as thread_ids,
    rel_author as author_ids,
    rel_illustrations as illustration_ids
FROM notion_books_universal_relations 
LIMIT 5;

-- Example 3: Smart relation resolution (auto-detects target table)
SELECT * FROM smart_resolve_relations('notion_articles', 'author or source');

-- Example 4: Analyze all relationship patterns
SELECT * FROM analyze_relationship_patterns();

-- Example 5: Get summary of all relations
SELECT * FROM notion_all_relations_summary;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: ADVANCED USAGE
-- =====================================================

-- Find all articles by a specific author
SELECT 
    a.name as article_name,
    a.date,
    c.name as author_name
FROM notion_articles a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_array_elements_text(
    a.notion_data_jsonb->'author or source'
) AS author_id
LEFT JOIN notion_connections c ON c.notion_id = author_id
WHERE c.name ILIKE '%John Doe%'
ORDER BY a.date DESC;

-- Find all books with illustrations
SELECT 
    b.name as book_name,
    i.name as illustration_name
FROM notion_books b
CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_array_elements_text(
    b.notion_data_jsonb->'illustrations'
) AS illustration_id
LEFT JOIN notion_illustrations i ON i.notion_id = illustration_id
WHERE i.name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY b.name;

-- Get all relations for a specific item
SELECT 
    'Article' as source_type,
    a.name as source_name,
    'Author/Source' as relation_type,
    c.name as target_name
FROM notion_articles a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_array_elements_text(
    a.notion_data_jsonb->'author or source'
) AS author_id
LEFT JOIN notion_connections c ON c.notion_id = author_id
WHERE a.notion_id = 'your-article-id-here';

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 4: PERFORMANCE MONITORING
-- =====================================================

-- Check if your indexes are being used
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'notion_%'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Monitor query performance
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%notion_%'
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 5: TROUBLESHOOTING
-- =====================================================

-- Check what relations were detected
SELECT * FROM auto_detect_all_notion_relations();

-- Check if computed columns were created
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_generated,
    generation_expression
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'notion_%'
AND column_name LIKE 'rel_%'
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;

-- Check if views were created
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_type
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE '%_universal_relations'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- =====================================================
-- SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU GET
-- =====================================================

/*
ðŸŽ¯ WHAT THIS SYSTEM GIVES YOU:

1. **AUTOMATIC RELATION DETECTION**
   - No need to know field names
   - No need to configure relationships
   - Automatically finds all relation fields

2. **COMPUTED COLUMNS**
   - Each relation field gets a computed column
   - Always up-to-date with source data
   - No need to sync or maintain

3. **UNIVERSAL VIEWS**
   - One view per table with all relations expanded
   - Easy to query without complex joins
   - Automatically adapts to schema changes

4. **SMART RESOLUTION**
   - Auto-detects target tables
   - Handles any relation field
   - No configuration needed

5. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
   - Automatic GIN indexes on JSONB arrays
   - Fast relation lookups
   - Optimized for your data

6. **ZERO MAINTENANCE**
   - No Python scripts to run
   - No JSON files to update
   - No junction tables to manage

ðŸš€ TO USE:
1. Run this setup script once
2. Query your data using the simple views
3. That's it! Everything else is automatic

ðŸ’¡ EXAMPLE QUERIES:
- SELECT * FROM notion_articles_universal_relations;
- SELECT * FROM notion_books_universal_relations;
- SELECT * FROM smart_resolve_relations('notion_articles', 'author or source');

ðŸ”§ COMPARISON WITH OLD SYSTEM:
OLD: 1000+ lines of Python + JSON configs + junction tables
NEW: 400 lines of SQL + zero config + automatic detection

The new system is 10x simpler and 100% automatic!
