An AI agent that can open a browser, navigate websites, click buttons, and extract exactly what I need\n \nHere's what I learned building this:\n \nWhat “forking” is and how easy it is to build upon open source software.\n \nHow front-end and back-end work, and how integrate with a cloud database.\n \nWhat “containers” are, like cool self-sufficient virtual machines that do stuff and interact.\n \nHow to integrate Claude, OpenAI, even if APIs fail more (and cost more ) than you'd think.\n \nHow AI models actually think, and how we can make them “follow a plan” and adapt step by step.\n \nThe hardest part? 🤖\n \nIt wasn't the code, it was making browsers think my bot was human. \n \nChrome profiles, session persistence, anti-detection tricks. What use has the agent if I have to login manually?\n \nUnfortunately, that part didn’t work (yet!!)\n \nBut I still loved that. Why? 🥰\n \nI learned a ton, and actually I went on and on because I could not sleep, thinking of “I might try this…”\n \nNow I have a much better understanding of how a full-stack app works, and the challenges.\n \nWhen I shared it with my wife she said “well is sounds like a master’s degree project”.\n \nHow much did it cost? 5€ in anthropic tokens.\n \nAnd it reminded me of the quote from Naval: \n \n“Learning is cheap, education is expensive”.\n \nAny cool projects you are working on?",

Chieh Huang defines it as the following: \n\nMicromanagement is taking great, wonderful, imaginative people, bringing them into an organization, and then crushing their souls by telling them what font size to use.😓\n\nThe feeling of not having control over our jobs can bring us much more fatigue than the work itself.\n\nSo, what is the source of micromanagement? 🔍\n\nWe start at the very bottom when we get hired. Doing work. \n\nAnd if we're really good at doing the work, the reward is more work. \n\nWe do more work, and if we're really good at it, we start managing people doing it. \n\nAnd at that moment, we start to lose control over the output of our job. And we may overreact by micromanaging.\n\nChieh argues that there is only one solution to micromanagement: trusting your employees to fulfill their roles.🤝\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExtract by a Ted Talk from Chieh Huang.

Engage in a community of practice. 🌱 🤝\n\nA community of practice (CoP) is a group of people with a shared concern, interest, or passion who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis.\n\nThis is the definition from E.

As a result, community members grow together. \n\nIllustration by me 😊 \n\nExcerpt from an article by Sara Ramos on the Management 3.0 blog. \n\nAnd you, are you a member of a CoP?

Put our heads down, grind, and go home to recharge for another work day.\n \nThe concerning aspect is that we might unknowingly choose this life, never considering if it's time to opt out.\n \nPerhaps it's worth questioning the \"default setting\" and living by design rather than by default.\n \nI love the reflection from Sahil Bloom on this topic. He sees two core ideas:\n \n✨ Being present and spending time with those you love is ultimately the most important thing.\n \n✨ If the people we love see us working hard on things we care about, they will remember this principle for the rest of their lives.\n \nWe ultimately \"win\" the game by understanding, navigating, and balancing the tension across these two. ⚖️\n \nThe goal is not to sacrifice our career progression, learning, and potential but to be constantly present with our kids.\n \nThe goal is to have clarity in choosing, to define our balance, and to live by design rather than by default.\n \n❓ A few questions that may help us think\n \nWhat do our loved ones know about our work? \n \nDo they understand why we're working hard on it? \n \nWhat lights us up about it, and how can we include them?\n \nI try to live by this, too. For example, as I wrote this, my kids were waiting to go and see a dinosaur exhibit. 🦕\n \nI was planning to stay home to write more, so my son Luca came in here and asked me if I could go with them.\n \nSo I said \"yes\" and switched one activity in the afternoon for the morning, and told them that I'll be with them in the evening again 😊\n \nUltimately, we will never know if we made the \"right\" choice, as perfection does not exist. Still, we can do our best to show up daily and simultaneously invest in ourselves.\"\n \nIllustration by me 😊\n \nExtract from an article by Sahil Bloom.

                "text": "Shedding old beliefs: blending feminine and masculine for harmony ✨\n\nLast summer, I read the book \"Alfas y Omegas\" by my extraordinary former colleague Mercè Brey, and by Victoria Yasinetskaya. 📖❤️\n\nAmong many of the ideas it expresses, two concepts especially caught my attention as a man, professional, and father of Valentina and Luca.\n\n🚧 The first is how important it is to overcome stereotypical behaviours and beliefs, specifically the traditional definition of masculinity.\n\n\"Demasculinizing\" the world has positive consequences for everyone, including men.\n\nFor example, being able to live an emotionally peaceful and sustainable life or to experience fatherhood in a heartfelt, authentic, and profound way.\n\n🌟 One of the keys to accelerating change is for well-known and recognized males who act as role models to other men.\n\nHe cites the example of Justin Baldoni, a Hollywood actor whose Ted Talk titled \"Why I'm Not Trying to Be Man Enough Anymore\" has over eight million plays.\n\nJustin's father passed on to him traditionally masculine skills while teaching him how to live his more emotional side.\n\nThis \"balancing\" between feminine and masculine values or traits is the second concept I loved. \n\nMercé gives an example adapted to the business world, where she indicates that \"in every business process there must be a continuous flow, an ongoing balance between the masculine and the feminine. ⚖️\n\nFrom the creation of a company to its expansion and growth, she identifies eleven situations.\n\n➡️ Ideation and creativity. More feminine to let our imagination run wild and dream and then land the idea with that results orientation that comes from the masculine. \n\n➡️ Market research. Rationality and analytics (masculine) and observation and empathy to read the market (feminine). \n\n➡️ Business plan. More rationality than emotionality. Masculine.\n\n➡️ Seeking and negotiating with investors. Confidence, decisiveness, ability to take risks, and communication skills. Masculine. \n\n➡️ Launching. Quick decision-making, working under pressure, and a high sense of insecurity. Masculine.\n\n➡️ Hiring talent and creating a workplace. Intuition, patience, attention to detail, and neutrality. Feminine. \n\n➡️ Establishing company culture. Culture and values require sensitivity and observation skills. Feminine. \n\n➡️ Set team goals and measure performance. Challenge and discipline are critical at this stage. Masculine. \n\n➡️ Negotiating with customers, partners or suppliers. Assertiveness, building trust, assertiveness, analytical skills, empathy. We get the best results with balance.\n\n➡️ Relationship management. Taking care of and maintaining the company's essential relationships, weaving a relational network. Feminine. \n\n➡️ International expansion and growth. Determination and boldness (masculine) and controlled risk-taking (feminine).\n\nHere are also some illustrations I have made inspired by the book 😊\n\nWhich one is your favourite? Mine is number four 🦜",

If this is how most people in an organization operate, the business will be slower.\n\nReliability also goes to the heart of what it means to be a team player. It removes the hierarchy and acknowledges that everyone relies on one another to achieve a goal.\n\nPaula Long captures the spirit of this idea. “I like to say that we’re all subcontractors to one another. It’s about accountability and respecting each other’s time.”\n\nI would build on that and add three ideas:\n\n✅ Treating each colleague as an “internal customer” and thinking as if they will have to answer the question “How likely are you to recommend me to others?”\n\n✅ Over-communicating and following up proactively, especially when we are struggling and in danger of not meeting a goal. It helps to build trust and transparency.\n\n✅ Whenever possible, overdeliver, even a tiny detail like extra thorough documentation or a 1:1 short call to anticipate the results. And in doubt, underpromise (but not too much)\n\nWhat is reliability for you?\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExtract from an article by Adam Bryant.

But other employees may feel overwhelmed.\n\n➡️ The authoritative style. \n\nA “come with me” approach states the goal and allows people to choose how to achieve it. It is less effective when the team is more experienced than the leader.\n\n➡️ The affiliative style. \n\nA “People come first” attitude. This style is beneficial for building team harmony but can allow poor performance to go uncorrected or omit crucial advice.\n\n➡️ The democratic style. \n\nBy giving workers a voice in decisions, democratic leaders build flexibility and responsibility and help generate ideas. But sometimes the price is endless meetings and confused employees.\n\n➡️ The coaching style. \n\nFocused more on personal development than on immediate work-related tasks. It works well with self-aware employees who want to improve but not when they are resisting.\n\nThe more styles a leader masters, the better. Specifically, switching among authoritative, affiliative, democratic, and coaching styles as conditions dictate is very effective. ⚙️\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExtract from an article by Daniel Goleman.

How?\n\nEnsure a psychologically safe environment for people to speak up.\n\nRevisit our mindset: sharing power does not diminish our authority.\n\nConduct self and team analysis: assess personal habits and the team's norms.\n\nInform everyone when to engage in divergent thinking and when to shift to convergent thinking.\n\nSet clear expectations: signal the working modes before meetings. Define shifts and use rituals to mark transitions.\n\nUse effective body language. Nonverbal behavior can reinforce or undermine your message. Read the room and know when to shift from command and control to empowerment.\n\nLeave, or avoid entering, the room. If everyone waits for your opinion, authority alone can squelch debate and create awkward silences.

That can leave us feeling let down after the fact.\n \n➡️ On the other hand, the No. 1 predictor of happiness is the quality time spent with people we care about and who care about us. In other words, relationships.\n \n➡️ To be clear, acknowledging the power of the arrival fallacy does not mean we should settle for a life of mediocrity. We need to have goals. We need to think about the future.\n \n➡️ Since we are a \"future-oriented\" species, purpose and meaning can generate satisfaction, which is part of the happiness equation. So, the advice is to set multiple concurrent goals in and out of work life.\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExtract from an NYT article.

                "text": "Breaking stereotypes: why introverts can also make great leaders 🙌\n\nCan introverts be leaders? According to Andres Raya Donet, the answer is a resounding \"yes\" ✨\n\nCarl Jung says introverted individuals draw strength and energy from themselves and not from the outside.\n\nThey are reflective and calm, enjoy being in small groups, think deeply before deciding, and learn from observation.\n\nIntroverted individuals make up about half of the world's population. However, 96% of senior executives prefer to define themselves as extroverts because of prejudice. \n\n🤐 Disclaimer: it is essential to avoid stereotypes. There is no better or worse profile; everyone can use their qualities to best deal with each context. And probably, we are not 100% extroverts or introverts.\n\n✅ Some of the strengths of introverted leaders:\n\nThey are more prone to humility.\n\nThey are excellent problem solvers.\n\nThey focus on actions rather than words.\n\nThey know how to generate enthusiasm and loyalty.\n\nThey are excellent mentors, as they strive to improve constantly.\n\nThey influence people by paying them attention and consideration.\n\nThey do not seek to dominate or feel threatened by proactive colleagues.\n\nThey will likely leave their ego in the background, even in high-stress situations.\n\n✅ Challenges introverted leaders face. In her book 'The Introverted Leader', Jennifer Kahnweiler talks about the \"four P process,\" \n\nPreparation: working on doing things in the way that best suits personal character. \n\nPresence: always focus on the situation we have in front of us without wandering\n\nPush: learning to get out of the comfort zone, assuming, from time to time, some risk.\n\nPractice: take advantage of opportunities to act effectively without renouncing one's personality.\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExtract from an article by Andrés Raya.

After hosting many workshops, I've experienced that \"just curious\" often means \"won't engage meaningfully\" or worse won't show up.\n\nThese sessions depend on preparation and participation, and it’s essential that people are committed and participate. The mood of the session also depends on the participants, and we co-create it.\n\nBut my frustration made me defensive instead of curious.\n\nThe feedback the person gave me: \"Running people off is wrong and unprofessional. Better to ask instead of assume.\"\n\nOuch. 🤕\n\nWhat I should have asked:\n\n\"What made you curious about this topic?\"\n\"What would make this workshop valuable for your time?\"\n\"What's your situation and what makes you think this is relevant for you?\"\n\nThe lesson: past patterns can cloud our judgment.\n\nYes, disengaged participants and no-shows are a real challenge for interactive workshops. But my job as a communicator is precisely to explore curiosity, not shut it down.\n\nMaybe the people who say 'I don't know' are exactly the ones who need to be there most.\n\nHave you ever let past frustrations influence how you handle present situations? What communication mistakes have taught you the most?\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nI am Roberto, and I curate hundreds of sources weekly about personal development, leadership, and innovation\n\nI share with you what excites me the most and will help you grow.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you might also like my newsletter, \"Journal of Discoveries\" (link in my profile) 📌📰",

If our glass tends to be half-empty, we may explore our feelings further by journaling, which can also help us recognize the positives. \n \n➡️ Conduct a cost-benefit analysis. It can be used to support us in challenging the patterns of thinking that have led us to focus on the negative elements of a situation.\n \n➡️ Ask for objective opinions.

Here are a few ways to enhance your ability:\n \n➡️ Hold your hypotheses loosely. Be willing to review your assumptions.\n \n➡️ Listen more than you talk. Active listening is understanding what another person is saying while being engaged and interested.\n \n➡️ Leave your queries open-ended. Avoid asking yes-or-no questions. Rather “how”, “what”...\n \n➡️ Consider the counterintuitive. Fight against groupthink, propose a counterintuitive question, one that challenges the group’s conventional thinking\n \n➡️ Stew in a problem. Don’t jump the gun. Wait and reflect a bit.\n \n➡️ Ask the hard follow-up questions. Do not accept easy answers, ask the “why”.\n \nPlus: three great questions to ask yourself, in an illustration by me 😊\n \nExtract from an HBR article.

When we let go of control, we foster more trust.\n\n➡️ How do we know if someone is trustworthy? Capability + character\n\nCapability refers to how someone does things and is demonstrated in two key traits: competence + reliability.\n\nCharacter refers to why you do things and is demonstrated in two key traits: empathy + integrity.\n\n➡️ How do we earn trust?\n\nThe most powerful way to earn trust is … 'I don't know.' ✨\n\nHumility is the secret to earning trust. If we admit we don't know when we don't have answers, people will have more confidence when we offer decisions and direction.\n\nIllustration by me 😊\n\nExcerpt from an article by Rachel Botsman via Nordic Business Forum.
