I was integration director during the biggest M&A deal in the financial system in Spain.\n\nI have always been and still am a very action and goal-oriented person, always in motion, always trying to improve everything.\n\nThis is what led me to become a co-active coach and a big believer in changing the ways of work for the better.\n\nI am organized, analytical, decisive, and highly autonomous, and developed the skills to be an effective team leader, internal consultant, and change management champion. I have a deep knowledge of performance management, data analytics, MIS, new technologies, and digital transformation projects.",
